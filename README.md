# String-Operations
## Aim
To perform operations of changing cases, splitting and encryption/decryption on strings.
## Description
Strings are an array of characters and in the three programs we have used strings as arrays to change the case of letters, to encrypt and to split the strings.

CHANGE CASE: In this program we have changed all lower case letters to upper case and all upper case letters to lower case. This has done by making use of the ASCII values of the letters.

SPLIT STRING: In this program we have split the string from an inputed letter using simple if else statement. 

ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION: In this program the string is encrypted using a user given key. The encrypted string is then also decrypted by reversing the encryption operation.
